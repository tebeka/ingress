Ingress is a pure Python, no dependencies REPL (interactive prompt) over the
network to your application (very much like [Twisted
manhole](http://www.lothar.com/tech/twisted/manhole.xhtml)).

Once installed (using `ingress.install()`), you can 'telnet <host> <port>' and
run Python commands on your server. This is very helpful in debugging servers.
